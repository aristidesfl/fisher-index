# [Fisherman][fisherman] Index

The Fisherman Index is a plain text flat database externally managed and independent from Fisherman.

The index lists records, each consisting of the following fields:

* **name**, **url**, **info**, **author** and one or more **tags**.

Fields are separated by a new line **\n**. Tags are separated by one space. For example:

```
fishtape
https://github.com/fishery/fishtape
TAP producer and test harness
test tool harness tap unit-testing
bucaran
```

The easiest way to submit new plugins for registration is using the [`submit`][fisher-submit] plugin:

```
fisher install submit
```

For usage see `fisher help submit` after the installation is complete.

You can also submit a new plugin manually and create a pull request.

```fish
git clone https://github.com/fisherman/fisher-index
cd index
echo "$name\n$url\n$info\n$tags\n$author\n\n" >> index
git push origin master
```
